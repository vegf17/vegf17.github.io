During the last round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s\nPost-Quantum Cryptography contest (NIST-PQC)[1] it was concluded that the proposed quantum-resistant\ndigital signatures lacked variability, thus requiring further candidates. During the NIST-PQC’s\nthird round, NIST withdrew PICNIC, a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) candidate, from the schemes to be\nstandardized due to concerns with its security. However, NIST stated that upon further research and\ndevelopment, MPC schemes could provide promising candidates for standardization. The fact is that\nduring the NIST-PQC’s contest duration, several MPC schemes that improved upon PICNIC’s performance\nand security appeared [2,3]. A big problem with their implementations is that these often detach\nthemselves from the original scheme leading to doubts about their security. To solve this issue, the\ntoolchain Jasmin-EasyCrypt[4,5] emerged allowing one to link optimized implementations to the\noriginal scheme’s security claims. In this talk, we will detail what an MPC scheme is and how the\nJasmin-EasyCrypt toolchain can provide high-speed high-assurance software implementations with\nproofs over these concrete implementations instead of proofs over a theoretical scheme.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Status Report on the Third Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.

This scenario could prove to be\nuseful to quantify the advantage, if any, in using quantum resources in distributed quantum\ninformation processing, and in particular secure multi-party computation. The resource-theory\ndiscussion in [1] and the general framework presented in [2] and [3], allow to describe the\nnonclassicality in such scenarios, taking into account the causal structure of the experiment. We\nwill describe this approach and try to apply the methodologies presented in [3] to the easiest and\nthe most fundamental example of quantum multi-party computation: quantum secret sharing [4].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Schmid, David, Denis Rosset, and Francesco Buscemi. “The type-independent resource theory of local operations and shared randomness.” Quantum 4 (2020): 262.\n\n[2] Wolfe, Elie, et al. “Quantifying Bell: The resource theory of nonclassicality of common-cause boxes.” Quantum 4 (2020): 280.\n\n[3] Zjawin, Beata, et al. “Quantifying EPR: the resource theory of nonclassicality of common-cause assemblages.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.10244 (2021).\n\n[4] Hillery, Mark, Vladimír Bužek, and André Berthiaume. “Quantum secret sharing.” Physical Review A 59.3 (1999): 1829.\n",
